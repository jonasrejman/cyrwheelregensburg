      The idea of this weekend is „each one teach one“: Everybody helps everyone
      to learn new skills so it's up to you to give in order to receive in
      return. Additionally there will be the opportunity to offer a workshop -
      think of a topic and level so I can write it down in our schedule.

      Your own Cyr Wheel, sleeping mat, sleeping bag, a big towel (for sauna!),
      cutlery, plate, mug, some food for the buffet. If you don't have a wheel,
      there is a limited number of wheels for rent (10€ per day). First come
      first serve! Please treat them gently.

      </h2>
      We are going to offer the possibility to present whatever you feel like
      showing us at the Open Stage on Saturday right after the last workshop.
      It's not gonna be a fancy show where you need to dress up in a costume and
      perform your stage act (but you can!). It is more about sharing your
      recent success with a new trick/combo/idea/showact with a loving and
      supportive community or simply practicing being on stage in front of
      people. The Open Stage is only for participants of the convention and
      friends, it's gonna be a great and fun experience for us all! So don't be
      shy and join in :)

      Workshop time is Saturday 10:00 – 19:00, Sunday 10:00 – 14:00 (official
      end: 16:00) There will be enough space for open training at any time
      Meals: There will be a buffet that is provided by YOU, so please remember
      to bring something so that there is enough. For dinner on Saturday we‘ll
      order pizza and on Sunday morning there will be breakfast provided.
      Sleeping: From 22nd to 23rd of March we can use the gym for sleeping, so
      don't forget to bring your sleeping bag and sleeping mat. If you have a
      long trip and plan on arriving one day earlier, get in contact with me
      (cyrwheelregensburg@web.de), we will figure this out. It is always
      possible to sleep in your van or caravan if you have one. No health
      insurance provided, participation at own risk. Take care of yourself and
      other spinners! If you have any questions, please contact us via
      cyrwheelregensburg@web.de or join our WhatsApp Group (QR-Code below)
