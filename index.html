      We are going to offer the possibility to present whatever you feel like
      showing us at the Open Stage on Saturday right after the last workshop.
      It's not gonna be a fancy show where you need to dress up in a costume and
      perform your stage act (but you can!). It is more about sharing your
      recent success with a new trick/combo/idea/showact with a loving and
      supportive community or simply practicing being on stage in front of
      people. The Open Stage is only for participants of the convention and
      friends, it's gonna be a great and fun experience for us all! So don't be
      shy and join in :)

      There will be enough space for open training at any time Meals: There will
      be a buffet that is provided by YOU, so please remember to bring something
      so that there is enough. For dinner on Saturday we‘ll order pizza and on
      Sunday morning there will be breakfast provided. Sleeping: From 22nd to
      23rd of March we can use the gym for sleeping, so don't forget to bring
      your sleeping bag and sleeping mat. If you have a long trip and plan on
      arriving one day earlier, get in contact with me
      (cyrwheelregensburg@web.de), we will figure this out. It is always
      possible to sleep in your van or caravan if you have one. No health
      insurance provided, participation at own risk. Take care of yourself and
      other spinners! If you have any questions, please contact us via
      cyrwheelregensburg@web.de or join our WhatsApp Group (QR-Code below)
